# VU-InGame-RCON
Does stuff.
Use with VU Console.

Add Admins in Shared/Config.lua
You can also set temporary Admins with 
  - temporaryAdmins.add <name>

You call all RCON Commands as:
  - vu-ingame-rcon.<command> <value>

I recommend to change the folder name of the mod to something shorter that you would like as prefix.
e.G folder name: rcon
--> new command structure: 
  - rcon.<command> <value>
